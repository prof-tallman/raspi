# Helper class for the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
#
# Designed after consulting the Arduino DHT sensor library v1.4.6 source code
# in C++ and referencing the AM2302 DHT22 datasheet. Borrowed some ideas from
# Zoltan Szarvas's 100% Python dht11 module that is available on PyPi. Tested
# on the Raspberry 4 model B using the DHT11 device that comes with the Elegoo
# "The Most Complete" starter kit.

    Reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 device. This object will
    cache its readings from the DHT11 device. Frequent queries will not read
    return a live value every time. Cached values will sometimes be returned
    instead. The constructor takes a wait period to control the cached value.
    '''

    # The DHT11 device shares a single pin that the host uses to initiate
    # temperature readings and the device uses to communicate data. Since both
    # the host and sensor drive the same signal, it's important that we hold
    # off on the host to avoid a situation where both the host and sensor are
    # driving opposite values. According to the datasheet, a full read from
    # the sensor takes 2 seconds, but our code runs a bit slower on purpose, 
    # so we will wait a full 5 seconds between all read operations.

        # HIGH->LOW). It doesn't really matter how *many* changes occur, just
        # the relative difference between LOW markers and the HIGH signals
        # that contain information. If the HIGH signal iteration count is 
        # greater than the LOW signal iteration, then it must be 70us signal
        # which represtns a 1. If the HIGH signal iteration count is less than
        # the LOW signal iteration, then it must be a 26-28us signal which
        # represents a 0. Thanks to Zoltan for for the idea.
        #
        # Loop until we receive a prolonged signal that does not toggle btw
        # 0/1. Within the loop we cound how many iterations pass until the
        # signal toggles. Once it toggles we store the count and reset our
        # counter. Repeat until reaching that prolonged constant signal.
